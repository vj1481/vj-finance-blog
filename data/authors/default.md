Myself Vijay a typical software engineer grinding through this 9-5 career from the past 10 years until 4 years ago I discovered the FiRe[Financial Independence and Retirement Early] movement and decided to take on the incredible this journey and along the way learned and discovered many things about personal finance, investing, lifestyle and entrepreneurship.

I will use this blog to document my journey as way of explaining my life/financial choices with my friends and foes.
